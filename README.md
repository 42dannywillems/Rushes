What's a *rush* in 42 ?
-----------------------

A rush is a small project which will be realized in a week-end almost all the
time. It begins in the friday evening and ends sunday evening.

Some need to be done with a random student, some alone.
The rushes subject are very various. It can be on a new programming language
(such as Prolog or LISP), a new framework or a theme (Security).

A rush is, as pools, an intensive part of the 42 school. When we face to a new
language or a new framework, we need to learn it in less of 2 days. Some rushes,
such as Prolog, are a first step in a new paradigm.

Most of the time, we don't have courses or videos on the subject: we only have
some useful links (and it's almost all the time links to official
documentation).
